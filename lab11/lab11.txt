Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
First the program does not have a start and end. So change x3000 to .ORIG and add a .END to the last line.
Then the program does not initialize the value for R2 and R0. So set R2 to -1 and set R0 to 0 at the begining using lable.
There is no lable for two of the .FILL, so I lable them to INITIAL and NEGATIVE.
Change the x300F in the innerloop to INITIAL
Change xxxx in the sti opcode to RESULT
Change BRpz to BRzp for the outerloop

Question 2: For each label in your code (with all bugs fixed), write down the corresponding memory location. 
INNERLOOP:	x3006
OUTERLOOP:	x3005
RESULT: 	x3012
INPUT:		x300F
INITIAL:	x3010
NEGATIVE:	x3011




Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
Labels make the most sense because it make editing much easier. The function of the program won't change when adding or deleting a new line.
