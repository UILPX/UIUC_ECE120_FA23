0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here
;Name: XP Liu
;Date: 11/10/2023
;General purpose: find the sum of all positive numbers stored
;load the number from corresponding location based on the pointer
;evaluate the sign of the number
;add to the sum if the number is positive
;counter minus 1 and pointer add 1 after each cycle
;repeat the step until all the number have been examined

;R1 is the current number from the memory
;R3 is the location of the numbers in memory
;R4 is the counter for the loop
;R5 is the sum of all positive number

1110 011 000110001; load the adreess of the first number to R3(x3132)
0101 101 101 1 00000; set R5 to zero by AND with x0000
0001 100 101 1 01010; set R4 to ten by adding 10 to R4

0110 001 011 000000; load the number in memory address R3 to R1
0000 110 000000001; check weather the number is positive, if positive, add to r5, if not, skip the
;next step
0001 101 101 0 00 001; R5 <- R5+R1, add the number R1 to R5
0001 011 011 1 00001; set R3 to R3+1, add one to location pointer
0001 100 100 1 11111; R4 <- R4-1, minus one to the counter of the loop
0000 001 111111010; check for the cycle runed, if less then 10 cycle is run, go to the load number 
;step, end cycle if ten cycle is runed.

1111 0000 0010 0101; halt the program.
